                        <p class="card-text">February 14 is not just about Valentine’s Day in India; it is also observed as Army Black Day in remembrance of the <b>Pulwama attack</b> that took place on February 14, 2019. This tragic event remains one of the deadliest attacks on Indian security forces, leaving the nation in shock and mourning.</p>
                        <p>🔹 What Happened on February 14, 2019?
                            On this day, a suicide bomber targeted a CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) convoy in Pulwama, Jammu & Kashmir. The attack resulted in the death of 40 brave soldiers, making it one of the worst terrorist attacks in India's history.
                            
                            The Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. In response, India carried out the Balakot airstrike on February 26, 2019, targeting terrorist camps across the border.</p>
